While reading Database Internals: A Deep-Dive into How Distributed Data Systems Work 1, its low level discussion of BTree internals peaked my curiosity into the efficiency of using a BTree to model an orderbook.</description></item><item><title>Adjusted t-stat for overlapping samples</title><link>https://www.uluwatu.xyz/posts/adjusted_t-stat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 19:56:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.uluwatu.xyz/posts/adjusted_t-stat/</guid><description>When computing a regression coefficient, we aim to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the dependent and independent variable ($ \beta_0 = 0 $). Similarly, when evaluating a trading strategies returns, we aim to reject the null hypothesis that they are unprofitable random noise around 0.
If we assume the distribution underlying the inputs are normal ($X_{0}$ for regression and $r_{t}$ for returns) we can use the t-statistic to decide to reject these hypothesis&amp;rsquo; or not.</description></item></channel></rss>
